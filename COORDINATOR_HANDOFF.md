# Coordinator Handoff: Lineage Fuzzer

## Relationship to the portfolio coordinator

This project chat owns Lineage Fuzzer's product, code, tests, demo, evidence, and submission. The
portfolio coordinator at `../COORDINATOR_PLAN.md` owns the shared DataHub and AWS deployment
contracts.

Before changing a port, public route, shared environment variable, DataHub namespace, deployment
topology, or global reset behavior, submit the proposed change to the coordinator. Do not edit the
live EC2 host from this project chat.

## Fixed project allocation

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Project slug | `lineage-fuzzer` |
| Internal port | `8104` |
| DataHub domain | `Demo / Lineage Fuzzer` |
| Required DataHub tag | `project-lineage-fuzzer` |
| Entity prefix | `fuzzer.` |
| Fixture root | `demo/fixtures/lineage-fuzzer` |
| State root | `/var/lib/datahub-hackathon/lineage-fuzzer` |

## Project-chat obligations

- Build only Lineage Fuzzer business behavior.
- Keep campaigns, mutations, evidence, generated controls, and reset inside this allocation.
- Fail closed if a mutation or reset target falls outside the `fuzzer.` namespace.
- Preserve exact-path fixture allowlisting and manifest-bound approval.
- Implement `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/readiness`.
- Keep the project independently runnable without the other four submissions.
- Update the milestone handoff below whenever deployment-facing behavior changes.

## Milestone handoff

| Field | Current value |
|---|---|
| Status | `in progress` |
| Milestone | Deterministic disposable commerce pipeline and verified restoration |
| Verified commit/artifact | Pending local baseline commit; coordinator records exact hash before promotion |
| Build command | `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` then `python -m pip install -r requirements-fixture.txt` |
| Test command | `python -m pytest` |
| Seed command | `python -m lineage_fuzzer.pipeline_cli seed` |
| Reset command | `python -m lineage_fuzzer.pipeline_cli seed` (deterministic destructive reset is implemented as a fresh scoped reseed) |
| Baseline controls | `python -m lineage_fuzzer.pipeline_cli controls` |
| Snapshot command | `python -m lineage_fuzzer.pipeline_cli snapshot` |
| Restore command | `python -m lineage_fuzzer.pipeline_cli restore <manifest.json>` |
| Run command | `lineage-fuzzer serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8104` |
| Health endpoint | `GET /api/health` verified locally |
| Readiness endpoint | Not yet implemented; blocks deployment gate |
| Disposable fixture | `demo/fixtures/lineage-fuzzer/lineage_fuzzer.duckdb` |
| Snapshot state | `demo/fixtures/lineage-fuzzer/.snapshots/` |
| Long-running workers | None |
| DataHub read | MCP client and probe implemented; live verification pending shared DataHub |
| DataHub writeback | GraphQL client implemented; live verification pending shared DataHub |
| Blockers | Shared DataHub deployment; readiness implementation; live read/write receipts |
| Evidence produced | 25 passing tests; Ruff clean; fixed-row fixture; canonical SHA-256 evidence; exception-safe exact restoration |

## Required environment variables

The project template now exposes the full shared contract. Current application settings still use
`LINEAGE_FUZZER_ENVIRONMENT` and `LINEAGE_FUZZER_STATE_DIR`; the coordinator deployment maps those
aliases from `APP_ENV` and `APP_STATE_DIR` until project code adopts the shared names directly.

```

## Implemented proof

- A fixed seed creates 30 customers, 120 orders, 14 daily-revenue rows, 30 customer-value rows,
  and one executive-dashboard summary.
- Canonical SHA-256 evidence covers all six managed source and downstream tables.
- Baseline controls deliberately cover the planned null-density fault but not the planned semantic
  scale or stale-partition faults.
- Snapshots are restricted to the coordinator-owned fixture root.
- Restore compares every managed-table checksum with the pre-campaign snapshot.
- An exception inside a campaign still restores the exact original checksums.

## Resource and deployment notes

- DuckDB and snapshots are disposable and ignored by source control.
- There are no workers or externally reachable services in this milestone.
- `requirements-fixture.txt` temporarily carries the DuckDB dependency; the project chat should
  consolidate it into `pyproject.toml` in its next code milestone.
- Expected application footprint is under 512 MiB; measure it before final deployment handoff.

## Next project-owned milestone

1. Implement `GET /api/readiness` using the shared contract without mutation.
2. Implement the three seeded semantic fault adapters and campaign execution.
3. Preserve before/after evidence and unconditional restoration.
4. Update this canonical file; do not create another supplemental handoff.

## Required deployment handoff format

When requesting deployment, replace all placeholder values and include:

1. Exact commit or immutable artifact identifier.
2. Required environment variables without secret values.
3. Build, test, seed, reset, run, and rollback commands.
4. Health/readiness results.
5. DataHub entities, reads, writes, and receipts.
6. Filesystem volumes and disposable paths.
7. Expected CPU, memory, startup time, and job duration.
8. Known limitations and demo concurrency behavior.
